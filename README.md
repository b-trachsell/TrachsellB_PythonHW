# Rock Paper Sciscors in Python.

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer- you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) to play.
Clone the project, navigate to the right directory- cd TrachesllB_PythonHW and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminalwindow for macOS / Linux.

The rules are the same as classic rock paper sciscors:
1. Paper covers rock
2. Scissors cuts paper
3. Rock beats scissors
*Choose your weapon wisley!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built in Python 3.
